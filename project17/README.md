Guessing the Number

Instruction
Create a program that will generate a random number unknown to the user between upper and lower bond that user provided. The user needs to guess what the number is. If the user's guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as to how wrong (e.g. The number is too hig or too low). If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication should appear.

    Your program should ask for upper and lower bond from the user initially.
    Calculate chances of user based on upper and lower bonds
    Based on calculated number of chances ask input from user for guessing the number.

    If the guessed number is greater than the generated number then print - "You guessed to hihg", otherwise print - "You guessed too low", And finally if the numbers match print - "Congratulations you did it in (number of guess made) tries"
